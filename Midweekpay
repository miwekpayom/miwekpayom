Midweekpay, Ohio passed bipartisan legislation that established clear rules and a level playing field for lenders. And by early 2022, the state had licensed nearly 120 locations to offer small loans. Several of these lenders are new to Ohio and had avoided operating in the state before the reforms because of a lack of regulatory clarity and an oversaturation of high-cost lenders. The total number of stores in Ohio declined after reform, which was expected. But the remaining stores became much more efficient, serving an average of 1,266 unique customers annually, compared with the national average of just 500. This increased efficiency enabled lenders to profitably offer loans at prices that are about four times lower than what they had previously charged, as required by the reform.

Further, since Virginia’s payday loan laws went into effect in January Midweekpay, new firms, such as financial technology and installment lenders, have expanded into the state’s small-credit marketplace, offering lower-cost loans and providing competition for incumbent lenders that updated their products to comply with the reforms.8 Although Virginia law had previously favored high-risk products by allowing much higher rates for single-payment loans and lines of credit than for small installment loans, the state now requires a safer, more transparent, and lower- cost installment structure.9 And lenders in the state are able to operate profitably in various ways, via storefront or online, and by offering only loans or a mix of loans, check cashing, and other financial services.
